APPPush
=======

Apple Push Notification's with server side code to manage push notifications messaging and handling with iOS Application. I have built many iOS applications and most have had push notifications enabled , We built a library that we use inturnaly that we decided to release as a open source project. This space has lost of open source projects but non offer a complete solution of server and client library that is production ready. This code is used in over 25 App Store projects and is well supported. 


Cocoapods
=========
pod install apppush

if you don't have cocoapods installed run 'sudo gem install cocoapods' to install cocoapods Ruby gem on Mac OS x.

Backend Server Side Code
========================
This project rely's on APPPush-Server which is a php web application to manage user devices and for sending push notifications. This code is is built on the work of other (easy-apns). it's not a fork we have rebuilt it from the ground up but it all started with (easy-apns) so we would like to give credit to the author for his hard work .
